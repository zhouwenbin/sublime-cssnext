# This repository contains the PostCSS plugin.

## Why **postcss-cssnext** ? What is the difference with **cssnext** ?

### Short answer

If you're using PostCSS in your build process, and want to add cssnext, you need only `postcss-cssnext`
(check the "options" section here below).
Otherwise, if you like cssnext to work as a full standalone package with its own cli
(independently of PostCSS), use `cssnext`.

### More details

cssnext was at first designed to be a complete tool, before PostCSS became
popular; thus, includes some options that don't really belong in a PostCSS
plugin (e.g., `import`, `url`, `compress`, `plugins`).
These days, most people use PostCSS directly so we decided to make integration of
cssnext more simple by providing a simple (real) plugin.

### Options

If you were using cssnext with some options here is what you need to know:

- `import`: just add into your plugins list
  [`postcss-import`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
- `url`: just add into your plugins list
  [`postcss-url`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-url)
- `compress`: just add into your plugins list
  [`cssnano`](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano)
- `plugins`: just add the plugins directly in your list
- `messages`: see
  [`postcss-reporter`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-reporter)
  and
  [`postcss-browser-reporter`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-browser-reporter)
- `sourcemap`, `map`, `to`, `from`: see
  [PostCSS source map documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#source-map)


## But I like cssnext as it was !

We plan to offer a simple migration by making postcss better.
